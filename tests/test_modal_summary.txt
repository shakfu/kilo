Modal Editing Test Summary
==========================

Due to the complexity of testing modal editing functions that read from terminal,
we have created test wrapper functions in loki_modal.c:
- modal_process_normal_mode_key()
- modal_process_insert_mode_key()  
- modal_process_visual_mode_key()

These are exposed in loki_internal.h for testing purposes only.

A full test suite (test_modal.c) with 30 tests has been designed but needs
manual row creation helpers. The test framework needs enhancement to support:
1. Helper to create test content with multiple lines
2. Helper to extract buffer content as string
3. Proper fd mocking for terminal operations

Recommended next steps:
1. Enhance test framework with content helpers
2. Implement full modal editing test suite
3. Add integration tests for mode transitions
4. Test paragraph motions with complex content
